    <h2>Smart Geofencing for Enhanced Security</h2>
    <br>
    <p><big><b>Smart Geofencing for Enhanced Security</b></big>Smart Geofencing is an advanced security solution that utilizes GPS, RFID, and IoT technologies to create virtual boundaries around a specified location. When an authorized or unauthorized entity enters or exits the defined area, the system triggers alerts, logs activities, or automates security measures.This technology is widely used in smart homes, workplaces, military zones, and asset tracking to enhance security. By integrating with mobile applications and cloud platforms, smart geofencing enables real-time monitoring, access control, and automation, improving overall safety and operational efficiency.</p>
